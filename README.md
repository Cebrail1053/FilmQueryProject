# Film Query Project

### Overview
This is a command-line program that presents a user with multiple options on how to filter the data
they are looking for.The program is designed to retrieve a query from a database to search for
films by ID or by keyword based on a user's input.

### Technologies Used
* JDBC
* MySQL
* Maven
* Object-Relational Mapping (ORM)
* OOP

### How to Run
1. The user is prompted with a menu to select whether to search by ID, keyword, or exit the program
2. After selecting an option the user is prompted for the search criteria
  * If the user selects the option to Exit, the program will terminate
3. The program then displays the filtered results of the search and prompts the main menu to the user once again.

### Lessons Learned
* Learned how to use retrieved data to construct Java Objects
* Got a better understanding on how to Join tables using primary and foreign keys
